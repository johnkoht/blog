[Content marketing and content strategy](https://www.kohactive.com/blog/content-strategy-for-the-bootstrapped-startup/) are some of the most buzzed about marketing terms. But what is content marketing? Basically, marketers now need to rely on good website content for potential users to find them. With each update rolled out by Google, optimized, relevant, and timely content becomes more and more important to improving the search results of your website. In addition to its impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization), great content helps your company prove its expertise and brand itself as a subject matter expert. But creating timely, quality content can be hard to do--especially if you're already wearing five hats. Here are some tips that should make creating good content easy (or easier) as well as effective.

1. **Stick with what you know.** One of the keys to a successful content marketing strategy is creating content that not only is highly relevant to your business, but is heavily searched. While there may be a lot of topics related to your business that are <a href="https://www.google.com/AdWords/KeywordToolâ€Ž" target="_blank">heavily searched</a>, if this is not your area of expertise creating the content will be a lot more time consuming. Stick with what you know very well. While you may miss some traffic opportunities, at least your content has the chance of being found by those searching for your exact product or service.

2. **Focus on what really matters--the headline.** Of course the entire piece of content is important. But don't create a post of 750 words that you're really proud of, and then just phone in a headline. [The headline is what makes users actually read your content](https://www.kohactive.com/blog/five-keys-to-writing-headlines-that-attract-readers/).

3. **Define your jargon.** Repeatedly using industry terms may help with SEO, but it won't help with comprehension if your reader is a newbie to your industry. Use industry words or terms sparingly--and be sure to define them whenever possible. This keeps the SEO value high while educating the reader.

4. **Link to others--and give them a shout on social media when you do.** This is the best way to get noticed by others who are creating similar content. Don't view them as your competitors, view them as your allies. The more links on your blog or website (both to other websites as well as links from other websites to your content) helps potential readers, and customers, find your content. This is a great way to begin to [find your influencers](https://www.kohactive.com/blog/influencer-marketing-for-startups/) as well.

5. **Share others content.** One step beyond linking to other websites is actually sharing their content--with their permission in advance, of course. If you indicate you've re-published the piece with permission, and link to the original source, you can build goodwill without having to create original content on your own.

6. **Leave the reader with a few takeaways they can act on easily.** This can be hard to do if you're writing about super technical topics, but typically, your writing should have a few takeaways; action items (or in the least, learnings) that the average reader will find valuable. This is how you drive repeat traffic to your website, and start to build a following to your blog or other marketing content.

7. **Ask people to sign-up to have your content sent to them directly.** This seems like a no-brainer, but once you start creating compelling content, getting readers or users to sign-up to keep it coming is a great way to keep engagement up.

Take these steps one at a time--remember, the most important thing is to create content regularly that your target audience will find valuable and relevant. And as always, <a href="https://www.kohactive.com/contact/">let us know</a> if you need some help!
