Over the past decade, we've helped companies build great products through our human-centered approach to design and development. We've worked with some amazing clients, from small startups to non-profits to enterprise companies. We're proud of the work we've created and people we've worked with.

As this year marks the 10th birthday of kohactive, we've we've decided to reinvent our brand to better represent who we are and what we do. We really love our new logo and we're excited to share with you.

<!-- LOGO Overview image -->

### First, a little backgound

kohactive is a software design and development consultancy. We partner with companies of all sizes to build web and mobile products. The very foundation of the company is to **cooperate** and **collaborate** with our clients. The "koh" in "kohactive" isn't about my last name as much as it is about how we work with and empower our clients--that's why the original logo emphazies the "koh" in a purple and "active" in a dark gray.

### Looking Forward

As we began to redesign our brand, we looked at how we can best symbolize this sense of collaboration and cooperation. The new mark represents this through the two layers of the "K". The top layer, distinct and bright, represents the client while the bottom layer, darker and complimentary, represents kohactive.

We also believe that the new mark symbolizes the products we build, our strategy and innovation services create two primary components of our products: the design and the technology. The top layer of our mark represents the design, the interfaces, and the graphical components of the products we build while the bottom layer represents the technology that lays behind the scenes and powers our products.

### Bright and Electric Colors

Our old brand was composed of flat, saturated colors. Flat was a great design pattern but for our new look, we wanted something new, something brighter, something more electric. We played around with a variety of color palettes until we fell in love with this colorful palette.

### What's Next?

We're relaunching our current website with the new branding. In the near future, we'll be launching a completely new website the better represents our new brand. We look forward to sharing that with you.
