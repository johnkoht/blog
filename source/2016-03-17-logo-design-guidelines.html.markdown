When it comes to print and web design, it’s important that you remain consistent across all platforms, formats, and treatments. Lots of people who have a cursory knowledge of Photoshop try to take on design challenges on their own, but it’s really best to hire a great web designer. That doesn’t mean that you have to turn to a designer every time you need a different size or variation of a logo--so long as you plan ahead when having your initial designs created. Here are some things to ask your designer for, which will help you in the long run.

## Logo Sizes
Unless you want to constantly resize the logos you have, it’s a good idea to have your designer save different size logos.

- One logo square at 200x200 (for social media)
- One logo square at 400x400 (for social media)
- One logo, original format at 250 wide
- One logo, original format at 500 wide
- One logo, original format at 800 wide
- One logo, original format at 1000 wide
- One logo, original format at 2500 wide


## Logo Colors
Once you have your brand colors chosen, and your logo is finalized, be sure to ask for different color variations. Depending on the use case, you will likely need:

- An original color logo
- A solid color logo in one of your company colors
- An all black version of the logo, with white background and no background
- An all white version of the logo, with black background and no background

## Logo Layouts
Logo File Types: Different file types are used in different ways. You’ll want your designer to save each variation of the logo in each file type, so it’s accessible and handy when you need it.

**jpg:** This is the most commonly used online logo type. This type will have a background.

**png:** This logo type is typically the largest of the online logo types, and sometimes isn’t supported by older browsers. The benefit is that you can have a crisp looking logo without a background.

**gif:** This is an image that supports movement--almost like a short, looping movie without sound.

**ai:** This is an Adobe Illustrator file--which is likely how your logo was initially created. This vector file is very important--it allows you to resize the logo as small or large as you like, or recolor the logo as you like. You should always save two versions--the original, and a second one with a different name, in case you save over the original. This can only be edited in Adobe Illustrator.

**eps:** This is another vector file type, but allows for programs other than Adobe Illustrator to make edits.

**pdf:** While you’re likely already familiar with pdf files, you’ll want to make sure to ask your designer for an editable pdf. In an editable pdf, the layers (parts) of your design are independent pieces that are able to be edited in a design program. This is necessary, as you’ll likely work with different designers.

## Hosting
Another easy thing to do is to have your designer work with your developer, and upload your logos to your server so they are easily accessible via links. Then, when someone asks for a logo, you can just send a link rather than having to find the logo over and over.
